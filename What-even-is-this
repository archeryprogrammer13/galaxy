I really just created an empty project and didn't touch it for like seven years didn't I?
Talk about procrastination...
The worldbuilding thing I originally created this for got discontinued as the comic I was writing for it got a bit risque, so to speak.
However, I do have a worldbuilding project that could fit in here nicely, so I might do that.
Maybe.
I dunno, having an interactive website for my Glistening Road worldbuilding could be really cool...
We'll see if I get around to it.
